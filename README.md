# Martin

Martin is a discord bot that's intended to do a variety of random stuff to make
life easier.

Currently Martin only does one thing, and that is to fetch the weather in the
configured cities for the configured users using [this](https://www.weatherapi.com/) free weather api
and then uses it to send a Discord message using a webhook and pings each user.

This way you will never forget to bring an umbrella when it's raining and you'll
always dress appropriately for the weather, provided you check your Discord
before going out of course :)

Check `conf.toml.example` for an example of the configuration that should be
provided to Martin to work properly.
